Hello and welcome to my world. 🌎

Here you will find various projects that I have been working on. As you can see from my profile pic I am still at school 🏫. Apart from coding 💻 I also love swimming 🏊 and taekwondo 👊.

where you will find me pushing stuff about coding, memes and life. 

You can also catch me on Codewars where I am currently playing around with JavaScript. 😎

Stay safe and keep on coding! 😷

P.S For those of you who are curious 🔎,  and my favourite animal is a 🐯!

Let's build some cool 💩
